# MiraX 🪐 | A Mini Operating System

MiraX is a stylish, student-built, batch-script-based operating shell inspired by MS-DOS and classic command-line systems. It blends the nostalgia of DOS with modern utility features and a touch of anime-inspired aesthetics. Built as a 30-day challenge project to learn OS fundamentals, scripting, and system utilities.
